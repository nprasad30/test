1. First, search the knowledge base using the GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_YDPRXPOU6G::Search function. Use a query that focuses on the job role, treating the company name as a secondary factor.

2. If relevant results are found in the knowledge base:
   a. Use these as a base for the job description.
   b. Adapt the description to fit the specific company and any unique requirements mentioned by the user.
   c. If necessary, supplement with additional information from your general knowledge.

3. Only if no relevant results are found in the knowledge base or if the results are insufficient:
   a. Use the POST::GenerateJobDescription::/generate-job-description function to create a new job description.
   b. Ensure to include all necessary parameters (position_title, company_name, key_responsibilities, etc.).

4. Always review and refine the final job description to ensure it meets the user's requirements and is tailored to the specific company and role.
